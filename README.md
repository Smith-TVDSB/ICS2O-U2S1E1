# Unit 2 - Section 1: Exercise 1
This example project is written in Python, and tested with pytest.

### The assignment
Make a program that takes in one number then outputs the following:  

The number is between 5 and 15: (True/False)  
The number is either less than 7 or greater than 13: (True/False)  
The number is not 9: (True/False)  

### Notes
The program should output True at the end if the statement is true, or False if the statement is false. There should be 3 seperate print statements.
